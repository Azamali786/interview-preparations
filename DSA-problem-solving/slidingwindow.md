## When to Use Sliding Window ##
You should consider the sliding window technique when you encounter problems with these characteristics:

# Fixed-size subarray/substring problems

"Find the maximum/minimum sum of subarrays of size K"
"Find all substrings of length K with distinct characters"

# Variable-size subarray/substring problems with constraints

"Find the longest substring with at most K distinct characters"
"Find the smallest subarray with sum ≥ target"

# Problems involving consecutive elements

"Longest substring without repeating characters"
"Maximum consecutive ones if you can flip K zeros"

## 20 Common Sliding Window Problem Types ##

# Fixed Size Window Problems

Maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size K

Average of all contiguous subarrays of size K

Count occurrences of anagram of a pattern in a string

# Variable Size Window Problems

Smallest subarray with sum ≥ target

Longest substring with K distinct characters

Longest substring without repeating characters

# String Pattern Matching

Minimum window substring (containing all characters of a pattern)

Find all anagrams of a pattern in a string

Permutation in string (check if pattern exists as permutation)

# Optimization Problems

Maximum number of fruits in a basket (K=2 case)

Maximum consecutive ones if you can flip K zeros

Longest repeating character replacement

# Counting Problems

Subarrays with product less than K

Binary subarrays with sum K

Substrings with exactly K distinct characters

# Efficiency Problems

Minimum size subarray sum (with positive numbers)

Replace K 0's to get the longest contiguous 1's

Maximum points you can obtain from cards (sliding window on ends)

## How to Identify Sliding Window Problems ##

Look for these keywords in problem statements:
"Subarray" or "substring"
"Contiguous" or "consecutive"
"Window" or "range"
"Maximum" or "minimum" length/sum
"K distinct" or "at most K"
