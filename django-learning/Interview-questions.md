Beginner Level

1- What is Django and how does it differ from other web frameworks?
    Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It provides a built-in admin interface, ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), authentication, routing, templating, and much more, out of the box. Unlike other frameworks, Django follows the "batteries-included" philosophy, meaning it comes with all the tools you need to build a web application, reducing the need for third-party libraries. It's known for being highly secure, with built-in protections against common security issues like SQL injection and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery).

What are Django models and how do they work?
    Django models are Python classes that define the structure of your database tables. A model class corresponds to a single table in the database. Each attribute of the class corresponds to a field in the table, and Django’s ORM handles the translation between Python objects and database queries. For example, a Book model might define fields like title, author, and publication date, which Django maps to a database table automatically.

What is the purpose of manage.py in a Django project?
    manage.py is a command-line utility that helps manage various aspects of a Django project. It’s used to run development servers, apply migrations, create database tables, and perform administrative tasks like creating superusers, testing, and running custom scripts. It essentially serves as an interface to interact with Django projects.

4- Explain the role of the settings.py file in Django.
    settings.py contains all the configuration options for a Django project. This includes database configurations, static files setup, installed apps, middleware, template configurations, and security settings. It acts as the central configuration file for Django, ensuring that all components of the project are properly connected.
