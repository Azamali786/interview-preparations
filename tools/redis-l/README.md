    - Pub/Sub
    - Transactions
    - Pipelines
    - Expiration & TTL
    - Caching Patterns (LRU, Write-through)

- What is redis ??
    - Redis (Remote Dictionary Server) is an in-memory data structure store.
    - Supports Strings, Hashes, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets, Bitmaps, HyperLogLogs, Streams.
    - Use cases: Caching, real-time analytics, queues, pub/sub messaging, session store.

- Installing and starting redis server
    - sudo apt update
    - sudo apt install redis
    - redis-server

    - Install uisng docker image from dockerhub
        - docker run -d --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis
        - docker ps (will show the status)

    python Client for redis is redis
    - pip install redis
    - connect to redis
        import redis
        r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
        print(r.ping())  # True if connected

    - connect using redis-cli
        - docker exec -it redis(container name) redis-cli, gets connected
        - wring ping returns pong
        - set name Azam  (set key=Azam)
        - get name (get key value)


- Redis Data types ??
    - Strings (Basic key-value like "username" => "azam")
        r.set("key", "value")   // r.set("name", "azam ali")  // using python
        set key valye   // set name "azam ali"  // using redis-cli 
    
    - Lists (Ordered list, supports push/pop from left/right ‚Äî queue/stack use cases.)
