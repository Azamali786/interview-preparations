📚 SQLAlchemy Mastery Roadmap for Production Applications (FastAPI Integration)
🛠️ Phase 1: Core Concepts (Foundation)
    - Goal: You should be comfortable creating models, sessions, and basic queries.

    - Installing SQLAlchemy
        pip install sqlalchemy
        python -c "import sqlalchemy; print(sqlalchemy.__version__)"    // check if installed correctly

        ✅ Create a basic Python file, e.g., database_setup.py:
            from sqlalchemy import create_engine

            # Create an engine (SQLite DB will be created automatically)
            engine = create_engine("sqlite:///example.db", echo=True)

            # echo=True means it will log all the SQL statements!


    - Core vs ORM — understanding the architecture

    - Engine & Connection

    - Sessions & Transactions

    - Declarative Base (creating models)

    - CRUD operations

    - Using Filters and Queries

🛠️ Phase 2: Relationships (1-N, N-1, N-N)
Goal: Build models that reflect real-world complex data.

One-to-One

One-to-Many

Many-to-Many

Association tables

Cascading operations

Eager vs Lazy loading

Advanced joins

🛠️ Phase 3: Advanced ORM Features
Goal: Learn how production apps optimize and structure database operations.

Hybrid properties

SQLAlchemy events

Using declarative mixins

Advanced querying with selectinload, joinedload

Working with Aliases

Writing custom SQL queries inside ORM

Session strategies (best practices)

🛠️ Phase 4: Migrations
Goal: Manage your database schemas as they evolve.

Alembic — SQLAlchemy’s official migration tool

Auto-generating migrations

Customizing migrations

Handling complex upgrades and downgrades

🛠️ Phase 5: Async SQLAlchemy with FastAPI
Goal: Write async code to match FastAPI's performance goals.

Async engine

Async session

Async CRUD operations

How to manage sessions per request

Transactions in async

🛠️ Phase 6: Real-World Techniques
Goal: Make your FastAPI + SQLAlchemy apps production-ready.

Dependency injection of sessions

Soft deletes (logical delete)

Versioned rows (audit trail)

Bulk inserts, updates

Connection pooling

Query optimization techniques

Connection retries

🛠️ Phase 7: Testing SQLAlchemy Apps
Goal: Write testable and maintainable APIs.

Using Pytest with SQLAlchemy

Isolated tests using in-memory SQLite

Fixtures for test databases

Mocking database sessions

Integration testing with FastAPI

🛠️ Phase 8: Bonus Advanced Topics
(Optional but powerful if you want to become an expert.)

Working with Multiple Databases

Sharding strategies

Advanced joins and window functions

Using SQLAlchemy Core expressions directly

Dynamic table creation

Data streaming and chunked queries
