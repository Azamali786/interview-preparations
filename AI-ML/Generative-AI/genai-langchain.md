Foundational Models: (generalised models)
1- LLMs(Large Language Models)
2- LMMs - Large Multi Models model

In AI there can be only two sides
1- user perspective (use use llms for theri work)
2- builder perspective (use builds the model) (train and test the model)


Prompt Engineering - User
RLHF  - Builder
RAG   - User
Pretraning - Builder
Quantization - Builder
AI Agents   - User
Vector Databases    - User
Fine Tuning     - User/Builder

Builder Perspective Side Curriculum : 
1- prerequisite
    a- machine learning fundamentals
    b- deep learning fundamenta
    c- deep learining framework : pytorch / tensorflow

Curriculum:
1- transformer architecture
2- types of transformers
    a- encooder only transfer (BERT)
    b- decoder only transfer (GPT)
    c- Encoder & Decoder based (T5)

3- Pretraning
    a- Training Objective
    b- Tokenization Strategies
    c- training Strategies
    d- Handling Challenges

4- Optimization
    a- Training Optimization
    b- Model Compression
    c- Optimizing Inference

5- Finetuning
    a- Task Specific tuning (RLHF)
    b- instruction tuning ( PEFT )
    c- Continual Pretraining

6- Evaluation (testing)

7- Deploy models


User Perspective Curriculum : 

1- Building Basic LLM apps
2- Open source vs Closed source LLMs
3- Using LLM APIs
4- Langchain
5- Hugging Face
6- Ollama

Now llms se jo response mil rha hai usko optimize(improve) karna sikhte ho

1- Promp Engineering
2- RAG (llm ko private data dikha ke QA karna)
3- Fine Tuning

AI agents
- difference b/w chatbots and AI agents
    (chatbot can only tell you about the tour places but ai agents can do bookings for you too on that places)

- LLMOps (deploy applications on servers)
- Miscelaneous ( diffucion base models)

AI agents using Langchain

Langchain : 
    It is an opensource framework that helps in building LLM based applications. It provides modular components and end to end tools that help developers build complex AI applications, such as chatbots, qa systems, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), autonomous agents and more
    1- supports all the mojor LLMs
    2- Simplifies developing LLM based application
    3- Integrations available for all major tools
    4- Open source/free/actively developed
    5- supports all major GenAI use cases


what to cover in langchain
1- fundamentals
    - what is langchain
    - langchain components
    - models
    - prompts
    - parsing output
    - runnables and LCEL
    - Chains
    - Memory

2- RAG
    - Document Loaders
    - Text Splitters
    - Embeddings
    - Vector Stores
    - Retrievers
    - Building a RAG application

3- AI Agents
    - Tools and Toolkits
    - Tool Calling
    - Building an AI agent
